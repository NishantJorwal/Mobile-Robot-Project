# Mobile-Robot-Project
Position Control and Trajectory Tracking of a Mobile Robot Using Fuzzy Logic Controller

This project endeavours to develop and assess a fuzzy logic controller designed for the precise positional control of a two-wheeled mobile robot through comprehensive simulation.

Within the scope of this research, MATLAB programming has been leveraged to execute simulations containing four distinct trajectories: a set-point trajectory, a linear trajectory, a circular trajectory, and a Lissajous trajectory.

This project is an academic project, so please refer to the report for a better understanding.
