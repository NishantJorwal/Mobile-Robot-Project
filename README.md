Position Control of Wheeled Mobile Robot using Fuzzy Logic Controller
This project aims to create and evaluate a fuzzy logic controller for controlling the position of a two-wheeled mobile robot through simulation.
In this project, we utilized MATLAB programming to simulate four trajectories: a set-point trajectory, a straight-linetrajectory, a circular trajectory, and a Lissajous trajectory.
This project is an academic project so please refer to the report for more understanding.
